# CarRentalProject
Programming 2 Final Project detailing our experience with C++ and Object-Oriented-Programming. This is showcased in a mock Car Rental System.
The user is able to perform basic things like renting out a car, adding and deleting customers, add and deleting vehicles, and even looking at existing customers and which cars are rented.
